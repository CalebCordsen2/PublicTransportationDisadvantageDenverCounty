    "This Juypter Notebook is dedicated to setting up code to support taking in census tract information on a number of indicators and loading these into custom census tract objects. It then performs a series of calculations in order to get percentile scores for census tracts in relation to others and exports the results to a spreadsheet. This is to service the author's final project in project management which aims to identify transportation disadvantaged census tracts in Denver County but theoretically this Juypter Notebook can be used to do the calculations on any set of census tracts given some minor modifications.\n",

    "### Class Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "To support operations concerning census tracts, this notebook utilizes a set of classes to load and store the data. To identifiy transportation disadvantage, 21 indicators are used. These 21 indicators are grouped into six categories. Thus a class exists for each category (Transportation, Health, Environmental, Economic, Resilience, and Equity). Each of these category classes contain member fields for the indicators that belong to that category. For example, the health class contains member fields for Population 65 and Older, Uninsured, and to indicate Disability percentage. In addition to these, these classes contain member fields for the percentile rank of each of these indicators. They then have properties that calculate the average percentile amongst their indicators and a property that reports if this category is considered disadvantaged (avgPercentile > 0.5 for most). \n",
    "\n",
    "Then there is a census tract class which contains member fields that consist of the six category objects. This class contains two properties, one to calculate total disadvantaged score and one to report if the census tract is overall transportation disadvantaged (total score >= 4).\n"
