# Identifying Public Transportation Disadvantaged Census Tracts in Denver County
## Author: Caleb Cordsen

This repo contains my script created to aid my project of identifying public transportation disadvantaged census tracts. It also has my data inputs before processing, my final deliverables and my final report. More information about this project can be found in the final project report. An interactive map displaying public transportation disadvantaged census tracts can be found at this [link.] (https://arcg.is/1uGG041).
